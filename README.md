## 🔧 GitHub Pages Setup Fix

### ❌ **Previous Issue**
The repository was experiencing **404 errors** when trying to access individual projects because:

1. **Missing Root Index:** No `index.html` file existed at the repository root
2. **GitHub Pages Requirement:** GitHub Pages needs a main landing page to properly serve subdirectories
3. **Direct Folder Access:** Users couldn't navigate between projects easily

### ✅ **Solution Implemented**
1. **Created `index.html`** at the repository root as a portfolio landing page
2. **Beautiful Landing Page:** Professional design with project cards and navigation
3. **Working Links:** All project links now work correctly from the main page
4. **Better UX:** Users can see all projects at once and navigate easily

### 🔧 **How GitHub Pages Works**
- **Root URL:** `https://username.github.io/repository-name/` serves `index.html`
- **Subdirectories:** `https://username.github.io/repository-name/folder/` serves `folder/index.html`
- **Requirement:** Each accessible path needs its own `index.html` file
